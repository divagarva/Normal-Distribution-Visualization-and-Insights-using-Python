# Normal-Distribution-Visualization-and-Insights-using-Python
 This Python project visualizes a normal distribution using matplotlib and numpy. It generates a bell curve based on specified mean and standard deviation values. The project also provides insights into the normal distribution's properties, such as symmetry, the 68-95-99.7 rule, and key statistical concepts.
